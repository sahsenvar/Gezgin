/**
 * A lossless one-shot effect primitive (§10.1, Faz 5 recheck / MJ2) — the RECOMMENDED backing for
 * [GezginMvi.effects].
 *
 * **Why NOT `MutableSharedFlow` + `tryEmit`:** `MutableSharedFlow(replay = 0, extraBufferCapacity =
 * n)` is a HOT stream and, because `replay = 0`, it keeps a value emitted **while there is no
 * subscriber** nowhere. In Nav3 a covered entry leaves the composition ENTIRELY → no collector; or
 * when the app goes to the background (`STOPPED`), [ObserveEffects]'s `repeatOnLifecycle` collect
 * is cut. If the VM calls `_effects.tryEmit(...)` in this window: (a) if the buffer is empty the
 * value is lost (no subscriber, no replay); (b) if the buffer is full (`extraBufferCapacity`
 * overflow — back-to-back effects in one frame) `tryEmit` returns `false` and the effect is dropped
 * anyway — and common fixtures ignore the return value. Result: when the user comes back the
 * snackbar/toast is NOT PLAYED. [ObserveEffects]'s "no toast lost when returning to STARTED"
 * promise holds ONLY with a buffered `Channel` backing.
 *
 * **Why `Channel(UNLIMITED)`:** a `Channel` is HOT but HOLDS the value until it is consumed. Even
 * without a subscriber, [send]-ed effects wait in the queue (`UNLIMITED` → [send] never
 * suspends/blocks, never drops) and are delivered IN ORDER when the single collector reconnects via
 * [flow] (`receiveAsFlow`) (return to STARTED / entry re-compose). An effect = exactly-once
 * delivery; that is why [flow] is for a **single** collector (`receiveAsFlow` does not fan out — a
 * second observer shares the value, it does not duplicate it).
 *
 * **Stable instance:** [flow] is set up once (`val`) → the SAME `Flow` on every access. In the
 * `ObserveEffects(vm.effects) { ... }` call inside a route-explicit effect handler, the
 * `LaunchedEffect(effects, ...)` key does not change on recomposition, so the collector is not
 * restarted needlessly. (A `get()` property that calls `receiveAsFlow()` on every access is
 * therefore WRONG — the key would change on every recomposition.)
 *
 * Usage:
 * ```
 * private val _effects = GezginEffects<CounterEffect>()
 * override val effects: Flow<CounterEffect> = _effects.flow
 * // ...
 * _effects.send(CounterEffect.Toast("saved"))
 * ```
