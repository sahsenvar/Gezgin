 * Task 6.2 — the route↔Bundle serialization half of `@FragmentScreen` interop (spec §11.1, Task 6.0 §3).
 *
 * A [Route] is encoded into the `arguments` Bundle **polymorphically** (`PolymorphicSerializer(Route::class)`)
 * — this is the SAME MECHANISM that `GezginKey.route` and backstack PD (`RawNavigator.save`/restore) ALREADY
 * use for a route; the polymorphism comes from the app's `SerializersModule` (not from Gezgin itself). So
 * EVERY route that survives Gezgin PD survives this too by construction (§3b). NO new Json/module: the
 * app-Json CARRIED by [nav] (`internal val json`, now module-visible) is reused.

 * bare `Fragment` subclass, with NO `RawNavigator`/composition/DI in scope — so it cannot read `nav.json`
 * directly the way `route.toBundle(nav)` (GENERATED code, `nav` in scope) does. Because [toBundle] is
 * evaluated (as the `arguments =` value) STRICTLY BEFORE `AndroidFragment` instantiates the Fragment, the
 * holder is populated before Fragment args are read on every composition (fresh-process included). One
 * `gezginSerializersModule` per app (§3.3) → one effective Json; equivalent for route polymorphism even with
 * multiple NavDisplays. `@Volatile`: a thread-visibility safeguard (in practice always the main thread).
