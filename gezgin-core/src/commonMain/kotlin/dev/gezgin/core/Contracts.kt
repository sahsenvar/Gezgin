/**
 * The **optional** typed home for modal presentation properties (§7) — a `@Dialog` route implements
 * this interface to carry the dialog window's dismiss/layout behavior as a **runtime value** off
 * the route instance (NOT from KSP — §2.4; the adapter reads it via `route as? DialogContract`). If
 * the route does not implement it, the adapter uses the default `DialogProperties` (identical to
 * `DialogContract`'s defaults).
 *
 * This is NOT a **marker** like `ResultRoute<T>`: it carries PROPERTIES. Two ways to supply them —
 * **use the `get() =` form in BOTH** (see the m5 warning below):
 * - **CONSTANT** (route-specific, no args): `override val dismissOnClickOutside get() = false` — an
 *   interface property override (defaulted → write only what you want to change).
 * - **CONDITIONAL** (depends on the call site): supply from a route ctor param — `data class
 *   Confirm(val cancelable: Boolean) : ..., DialogContract { override val dismissOnClickOutside
 *   get() = cancelable }`. The route is already `@Serializable` → no extra work, the param is
 *   serialized (PD-safe).
 *
 * **OPEN-TIME CONSTANT (not live state):** these getters are read ONCE when the entry is built and
 * captured into an immutable `DialogProperties`; they are NOT re-read while the dialog is open. So
 * the getter must depend only on the ROUTE INSTANCE (ctor params / constants) — a getter reading
 * changing UI state (e.g. `get() = someTextField.isNotBlank()`) will NOT make the dialog's dismiss
 * behavior react as that state changes; the value is frozen at the value it had when the dialog
 * opened.
 *
 * **m5 — `get() =` is REQUIRED (do NOT write an initializer `val`):** writing `override val
 * dismissOnClickOutside = false` (a backing-field initializer) makes kotlinx.serialization include
 * this property in the `@Serializable` route's SERIALIZED SCHEMA → the presentation prop leaks into
 * the saved-state (PD) format. With `encodeDefaults=false` the actual data may be harmless, but the
 * schema is polluted and it is unnecessary; the `get() =` form produces no backing field
 * (getter-only) and never enters the schema. So use the getter form even in the CONSTANT case.
 *
 * The fields map **one-to-one** to the real fields of `DialogProperties` (in the adapter,
 * [dev.gezgin.core.compose.toNavEntry]):
 * - [dismissOnBackPress] → `DialogProperties.dismissOnBackPress` (back button/Esc dismisses the
 *   dialog).
 * - [dismissOnClickOutside] → `DialogProperties.dismissOnClickOutside` (tapping outside dismisses).
 * - [usePlatformDefaultWidth] → `DialogProperties.usePlatformDefaultWidth`. The concrete
 *   counterpart of §7's abstract `layout` property: `true` = platform-default dialog width
 *   (wrapped), `false` = the content decides its own width (wide/near-fullscreen). Using this name
 *   instead of `layout` avoids hiding which `DialogProperties` field it maps down to (minimal
 *   magic).
 *
 * dismiss (tap-outside/Esc/when back is allowed) → the dialog scene's `onDismissRequest = onBack` →
 * `navigator.back()` → pop; if the route is a `ResultRoute`, the caller receives `Canceled` (the
 * existing `back()` path).

 * The **optional** typed home for BottomSheet presentation properties (§7) — a `@BottomSheet` route

 * (identical to the defaults below). Overrides must use the `get() =` form ([DialogContract]'s m5
 * warning — an initializer `val` leaks into the serialized schema).
 *
 * **Prop set — five fields mapping to the REAL knobs of material3 `ModalBottomSheet`** (the dismiss
 * pair symmetric with [DialogContract] + sheet-specific state/gesture knobs):
 * - [skipPartiallyExpanded] → `rememberModalBottomSheetState(skipPartiallyExpanded = ...)`. When
 *   `true` the sheet skips the intermediate (half-expanded) stop; it goes straight to fully
 *   expanded or hidden (for short-content sheets).
 * - [dismissOnBackPress] → `ModalBottomSheetProperties(shouldDismissOnBackPress = ...)`. When
 *   `false` the back button does not dismiss the sheet. Parallel to
 *   [DialogContract.dismissOnBackPress]; it is subject to the **same `@NoBack` guard**
 *   (`require(!(noBack && dismissOnBackPress))` in the adapter — a setup-time runtime check, §7).
 * - [dismissOnClickOutside] → `ModalBottomSheetProperties(shouldDismissOnClickOutside = ...)`.
 *   Whether a scrim-tap (outside tap) dismisses the sheet; default `true`. `false` → tap-outside
 *   does not dismiss, but swipe-down and the back button (if allowed) STILL work. Parallel to
 *   [DialogContract.dismissOnClickOutside].
 * - [sheetGesturesEnabled] → `ModalBottomSheet(sheetGesturesEnabled = ...)`. Whether user
 *   drag/swipe gestures can move or dismiss the sheet; default `true`. This is independent from
 *   outside dismissal. For a `@NoBack` sheet, both [dismissOnBackPress] and this property must be
 *   `false` so user back/swipe cannot hide the sheet while its route remains on the stack.
 *   Programmatic navigator back and [dev.gezgin.core.compose.GezginSheetController.hideAndBack]
 *   remain available.
 * - [dragHandleMode] is a migration-only bridge. [BottomSheetDragHandleMode.Default] preserves
 *   Material's default handle; [BottomSheetDragHandleMode.None] passes `dragHandle = null` so a
 *   consumer may render its own handle in sheet content. It is not the permanent presentation-slot
 *   API.
 *
 * dismiss (swipe-down / scrim-tap / when back is allowed) → the sheet's `onDismissRequest = onBack`
 * → `navigator.back()` → pop; if the route is a `ResultRoute`, the caller receives `Canceled` (the
 * existing `back()` path — in material3 swipe+scrim+back ALL THREE funnel into a single
 * `onDismissRequest`, jar-verified).
